<ul><font face="century gothic" size="4">
	<li> Movements within the Earthâ€™s crust cause stress to build up at points of weakness and rocks to deform.</li>
	<li>Stored energy builds up in the same way as energy builds up in the spring of a watch when it is wound.</li>
	<li> When the stress finally exceeds the strength of the rock, the rock fractures along a fault, often at a zone of existing weakness within the rock. The stored energy that is suddenly released as an earthquake!</li>
	<li>Intense vibrations, or seismic waves, spread out from the initial point of rupture, the focus, like ripples on a pond. These waves are what makes the ground shake and can travel large distances in all directions.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<p align=" center"><img src=" bend.jpg" ></p>
<p><font face="century gothic" size="4"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen you bend a plastic ruler it stores the energy that you subject it to. If you bend the ruler beyond its elastic limit it will fracture or snap!. The snap &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsound you hear is a release of some of the the energy you stored within it.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="century gothic" size="5"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHOW TO PREPARE FOR AN EARTHQUAKE</font></b></p>

<p><font face="century gothic" size="5"> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAn earthquake can be a very destructive natural disaster, particularly in the Pacific Rim region. After an &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspearthquake, your home may be a mess and you might be left without a water supply or power. There are &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspseveral things you can do to prepare for an earthquake before it happens, to minimize the damage and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppotential for injury in and around your home.
</p>


	<p align="center"><font face="century gothic" size="6"><b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPreparing an Emergency Plan</b></font></p>
	<br>
<ol>
	<li>
	<font face="century gothic" size="5"><b> Create a Disaster Preparedness Plan for your house or place of work.</b></font>
	<p align=" center"><img src=" plan.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	</li>
<ul>
	<font face="century gothic" size="4"><br><br>
	<li> <b>Identify the best places for cover in your building.</b></li> 
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4"> Under sturdy desks and tables and inside strong interior door frames are good places. If there is no other cover, lay on the floor next to an interior wall and protect your head and neck. Stay away from large furniture, mirrors, external walls and windows, kitchen cabinets, and anything heavy that isn't bolted down.</font></p>
	<li> <b>Teach everyone how to signal for help if trapped. </b></li> 
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4"> Rescuers searching collapsed buildings will be listening for sounds, so try knocking three times repeatedly or blow an emergency whistle if you have access to one.</font></p>
	<li> <b>Practice until it is second nature.</b></li>
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4"> Practice this plan often -- you only have a few seconds to make adjustments in a real earthquake.</font></p>
	</font>
</ul>

	<li><font face="century gothic" size="5"><b> Practice "drop, cover and hold on" until it becomes second nature. </b></font></li>
	<br>
<ul>
	
	<p align=" center"><img src=" duck.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	<br>
	 <p><font face="century gothic" size="4">
	In a real earthquake, this is your number one defense. Drop to the floor, take cover under a sturdy desk or table and hold on firmly. Be prepared for shaking and falling objects. You should practice this in every room of the house, knowing your protected areas no matter where you are when an earthquake hits.</font></p>
	<li>
	<font face="century gothic" size="4"> 	If you are outside, move into the open, away from anything that could fall or collapse like telegraph poles and buildings. Drop and cover your head from falling objects. Stay there until the shaking stops.</font>
	</li>
</ul>
	
	<br><br>
	
	<li><font face="century gothic" size="5"><b> Learn basic first aid and CPR or make sure there is at least one person in the house knows it. </b></font></li>
	<br>
	
	<p align=" center"><img src=" first aid.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4"> There are resources in your community to educate you and your family on how to deal with first aid emergencies. Your local Red Cross has monthly classes as well that will teach you the basic skills to deal with most common injuries and situations.</font></p>
	
	<ul>
	<li><font face="century gothic" size="4"> If you cannot attend a class, purchase basic first aid books and put them with each stash of emergency supplies in the house. Having a first aid kit is highly recommended.</font>
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<br><br>
	
	<li><font face="century gothic" size="5"><b>Decide on a rallying point for your family for after the earthquake. </b></font></li>
	<br>
	<p align=" center"><img src=" area.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4"> It should be away from buildings. Go over what your family should do in the event that not everyone makes it to the rallying point. If you have civil defense safety meeting points (as designated by your town), be sure that every member of the family knows the location of the one closest to home, school, and work.</font></p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>
	<font face="century gothic" size="4"> Identify an out-of-area contact person, like an out-of-state aunt or uncle, that your family can call and get in touch with one another. If you can't call each other for some reason, make sure you call them to help coordinate a meet-up. Use FRS and GMRS service (GMRS requires a license by FCC in US) to contact each other. Phone lines get congested in disaster. Some FRS and GMRS radio can send radio waves up to 40 miles!</font>
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<br><br>
	
	<li><font face="century gothic" size="5"><b>Learn how to turn off the utilities in your house, especially the gas line.  </b></font></li>
	<br>
	<p align=" center"><img src=" pipe.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4"> A broken gas line leaks flammable gas into the environment which can lead to a very dangerous explosion if untended. You should learn how to operate your utilities now so that, in the event you smell leaking gas, you can quickly stop the problem.</font></p>
	
	<li><font face="century gothic" size="5"><b>Write down and share emergency contact lists.</b></font></li>
	<br>
	<p align=" center"><img src=" contactlist.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4"> This should include everyone in your home, office, etc. You need to know who must be accounted for and how to get in touch with them if they can't be found. In addition to normal contact information, ask each person to provide and emergency contact as well. You should also include:</font></p>
	
	<ul>
	<font face="century gothic" size="4"> 
	<li>Names and numbers of neighbors.</li>
	<li>Name and number of the landlord.</li>
	<li>Important medical information.</li>
	<li>Emergency numbers for fire, medical, police, and insurance.</li>
	</font>
	</ul>
	
	<br>
	
	<li><font face="century gothic" size="5"><b>Try to develop routes and methods for getting home after an earthquake has occurred. </b></font></li>
	<br>
	<p align=" center"><img src=" map.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4"> There is no way to know what time of day an earthquake might strike, you may be at work, at school, on a bus, or in a train when one strikes. It is highly likely that you will need to know several ways to get home since roads and bridges will likely be obstructed for long periods of time. Note any potentially dangerous structures, like bridges, and figure out a route around them if need be.

<p align="center"><font face="century gothic" size="6"><b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPreparing an Emergency Earthquake Kit</b></font></p>
	<br>
<ol>
	<li>
	<font face="century gothic" size="5"><b> Prepare a disaster supply kit, and inform the entire household of its location.</b></font>
	<p align=" center"><img src=" kit.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4">Earthquakes can trap people in their homes for days at a time in the worst case scenario, so you need everything for survival in the house.</font></p>
	<ul>
	<font face="century gothic" size="4">
	<li> If you have a large house or family, more than 4-5 people, consider making extra kits and leaving them in different sections of the house.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<li>
	<font face="century gothic" size="5"><b> Purchase enough emergency food and water for at least three days. </b></font>
	<p align=" center"><img src=" food.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4"> You should have a gallon of water for each family member, plus a few more for emergencies. Make sure you have a manual can opener to get into tinned emergency rations as well. You can purchase any non-perishable food you prefer, such as:</p></font>
	<ul>
	<font face="century gothic" size="4">
	<li>Canned foods, like fruits, vegetables, beans, and tuna.</li>
	<li> Processed crackers and salty snacks.</li>
	<li>Camping food.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<li>
	<font face="century gothic" size="5"><b> Buy a solar or manual crank flashlight and radio, or a normal flashlight with extra batteries. </b></font>
	<p align=" center"><img src=" tools.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4">. You should preferably have one for each individual in the house. Get a portable, battery-operated radio as well. There are some models that are solar or kinetically powered that may be worth an investment as you'll never have to worry about batteries.</font></p>
	<ul>
	<font face="century gothic" size="4">
	<li> 	You should also purchase glow-sticks, matches, and candles as backup options.</li>
	</font>
	</ul>
	
	<li>
	<font face="century gothic" size="5"><b>Create a First Aid kit. </b></font>
	<p align=" center"><img src=" firstaid.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4"> This is one of the most important objects in your emergency kit, and needs to be fully stocked with the following.</font></p>
	<ul>
	<font face="century gothic" size="4"> 
	<li> Bandages and Gauze</li>
	<li>Antibiotic ointments and alcohol wipes</li>
	<li>Pain-relievers</li>
	<li>Broad spectrum antibiotic pills</li>
	<li>Anti-diarrhea medication (essential to fight dehydration in an emergency)</li>
	<li>Scissors</li>
	<li>Gloves and dust masks</li>
	<li>Needle and thread</li>
	<li>Splinting material</li>
	<li>Compression wraps</li>
	<li>Up-to-date prescriptions</li>
	<li>Water purification tablets</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<li>
	<font face="century gothic" size="5"><b>Put together a basic tool kit that can help get out of the house in an emergency. </b></font>
	<p align=" center"><img src=" equipments.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4">You may need to help rescue crews, or move fallen debris trapping you in the house. You should have:</font></p>

	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4"> While everything above is essential to a good survival kit, the following materials should also be rounded up if time and money allow:</font></p>
	<ul>
	<font face="century gothic" size="4"> 
	<li>Pillows and blankets</li>
	<li>Closed-toe shoes</li>
	<li>Plastic bags</li>

	<p align="center"><font face="century gothic" size="6"><b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPreparing Your Home to Minimize Damage</b></font></p>
	<br>
<ol>
	<li>
	<font face="century gothic" size="5"><b> Fasten any large items securely to the walls and floor. </b></font>
	<p align=" center"><img src=" secure.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4">There are a number of specific hazards in your home that you can deal with before an earthquake occurs. The biggest danger is actually from falling objects inside your house. Luckily, these sorts of injuries can be prevented with some forethought:</font></p>
	<ul>
	<font face="century gothic" size="4"> 
	<li>Fasten all shelves securely to the walls.</li>
	<li>Use brackets to attach wall units, bookcases, and other tall furniture to wall studs. Standard steel brackets are fine and easy to apply.</li>
	<li>Place large, heavy objects on lower shelves or on the floor. They might fall during an earthquake and the less distance they have to fall, the better. You can also screw objects onto things, such as a desk.</li>
	<li>Use non-slip mats to prevent objects with a low center of gravity from sliding. For example, fish bowls, vases, floral arrangements, statues, etc.</li>
	<li>Use an invisible nylon cord to secure tall, heavy items that can topple over to the wall. Place an eye screw in the wall, and tie the thread around the object (such as a vase) and then tie it to the eye screw.</li>
	</font>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<li>
	<font face="century gothic" size="5"><b> Install shatter-safe window films to protect from breaking glass.  </b></font>
	<p align=" center"><img src=" glass.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4">In a last-minute pinch, placing masking tape across the diagonals (in an "X") of your windows can keep them from shattering. Most earthquake prone areas will already require these windows, but you should check to make sure.</font></p>
	
	<br>
	
	<li>
	<font face="century gothic" size="5"><b> Place breakable items in closed cabinets that have latches. </b></font>
	<p align=" center"><img src=" breakable.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4">Lock or latch them up so that the cabinet doors cannot fly open. Use poster tack/plastic putty to keep ornaments, figurines, and glassware adhered to shelves and mantelpieces.</font></p>
	<ul>
	<font face="century gothic" size="4"> 
	<li>There are even special commercial quake putties available, allowing you to secure objects in place securely.</li>
	</font>
	</ul>
	
	<br>
	
	<li>
	<font face="century gothic" size="5"><b> Remove or secure hanging objects from above seating and sleeping areas. </b></font>
	<p align=" center"><img src=" bed.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4"> Heavy pictures, light fixtures, and mirrors should be hung away from beds, couches, and anywhere that someone might sit. Conventional picture hooks will not hold pictures during an earthquake, but they are easy to fix - simply push the hook closed, or use a filler material to fill the gap between the hook and its backing.</font></p>
	<ul>
	<font face="century gothic" size="4"> 
	<li> Other alternatives include buying special art hooks and ensuring that heavy paintings have adequate, strong hooks and cord.</li>
	</font>
	</ul>
	
	<br>
	
	<li>
	<font face="century gothic" size="5"><b> Check that your house is up-to-date with earthquake protections. </b></font>
	<p align=" center"><img src=" protection.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4">A landlord or your local zoning board can help you determine this. If you have any deep cracks in the ceiling or foundations, repair these immediately. You might need to consult an expert if there are signs of structural weakness. Make sure your foundation is properly braced and that all modern laws and building regulations are being complied with.</font></p>
	<ul>
	<font face="century gothic" size="4"> 
	<li> Have flexible fittings placed on your gas pipes. A professional plumber will need to do this. It's also a good idea to have flexible fittings on your water pipes, so have these fixed at the same time.</li>
	<li>If your house has a chimney, secure it to the walls of the house using galvanized metal angles and bands at the top, ceiling line, and base. The angles can be bolted to the wall, and to ceiling joists or rafters if you have cladding on the house. For the part of the chimney sitting above the roof-line, brace it to the roof.</li>
	<li>Evaluate your electrical wiring, electrical appliances, and gas connections. Do any repairs if needed. During an earthquake, faulty fittings and wiring can become a potential fire hazard. When securing appliances, be sure not to drill holes in them. You can use existing holes, or make loops from leather, that can be glued onto an appliance.</li>
	</font>
	</ul>
	
	<br>
	
	<li>
	<font face="century gothic" size="5"><b>Work with your community to prepare for earthquakes together.</b></font>
	<p align=" center"><img src=" prepare.jpg" width="550"  ></p>
	<p><font face="century gothic" size="4">If there aren't civic groups present in your area focused on earthquake preparedness, work on creating one. Here you can share resources, find meeting points, and provide support for one another in the case of an earthquake.</font></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p align="center"><font face="century gothic" size="6"><b> Earthquake Response Plan</b></p>
<ol>
<font face="century gothic" size="4">
<li>During an earthquake, remain calm and quickly follow the steps outlined below.</li><br>
<li>If indoors, seek refuge in a doorway or under a desk or table. Stay away from glass windows, shelves and heavy equipment. <b><br> IF INDOORS DURING AN EARTHQUAKE EXIT THE BUILDING ONLY AFTER THE SHAKING HAS STOPPED.</b></li><br>
<li>If outdoors, move quickly away from buildings, utility poles, and other structures. <br>
	<b>Caution:</b> Always avoid power or utility lines as they may be energized.<br><br>
<li>If in an automobile, stop in the safest place available, preferably an open area away from power lines and trees. Stop as quickly as safety permits, but stay in the vehicle for the shelter it offers.</li></br>
<li> After the initial shock, evaluate the situation and, if emergency assistance is necessary, call the call the University Police Department at extension 4357 (HELP) or 256.765.4357, and the Building Coordinator. Protect yourself at all times and be prepared for after-shocks.</li><br>
<li>Damaged facilities should be reported to the University Police Department and the Building Coordinator. Note: Gas leaks and power failure create special hazards. Please refer to the sections on <b>UTILITY FAILURE.</b></li><br>
<li><b>ASSIST THE DISABLED IN EVACUATING THE BUILDING.</b> Remember that elevators are reserved for disabled persons' use only. <b>DO NOT USE ELEVATORS IN CASE OF FIRE OR EARTHQUAKE.</b><br><br>
<li>Once outside, move to a clear area away from the affected building(s). Keep streets and walkways clear for emergency vehicles and personnel.</li><br>
<li>If requested, assist the University Police Department and/or the Building Coordinator.</li><br>
<li>Buildings will be equipped with emergency response kits which will include flashlights, radios, first aid supplies, etc.</li><br>
<li><b>DO NOT RETURN TO AN EVACUATED BUILDING</b> unless directed to do so by the University Police Department or the Building Coordinator.</li><br>
<li><b>STAY CALM.</b> All emergency response efforts will require clear thinking and cooperation from all member of the campus community.</li><br>
<li>Refer to the emergency procedures specific to your building.</li><br>
