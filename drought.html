<p><b><font face="century gothic" size="5">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp WHAT IS AN EL NINO and LA NINA?</font></b></p>
<ul><font face="century gothic" size="4">
	<li> El Niño and La Niña are opposite phases of what is known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. The ENSO cycle is a scientific term that describes the fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and atmosphere in the east-central Equatorial Pacific</li>
	<li>The term El Niño refers to the large-scale ocean-atmosphere climate interaction linked to a periodic warming in sea surface temperatures across the central and east-central Equatorial Pacific.</li>
	<li>La Niña is sometimes referred to as the cold phase of ENSO and El Niño as the warm phase of ENSO. These deviations from normal surface temperatures can have large-scale impacts not only on ocean processes, but also on global weather and climate.</li>
	<li>El Niño and La Niña episodes typically last nine to 12 months, but some prolonged events may last for years. While their frequency can be quite irregular, El Niño and La Niña events occur on average every two to seven years. Typically, El Niño occurs more frequently than La Niña.</li>
	<li>During a La Niña year, winter temperatures are warmer than normal in the Southeast and cooler than normal in the Northwest.</li>

<p><b><font face="century gothic" size="5"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPreparing for El Niño and La Niña</font></b></p>

<ol>
	<li><font face="century gothic" size="5">Prepare your house for El Niño.</font></li>
		<ul>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4"> Keep emergency repair materials handy. </font></b></li>
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3">Sandbags, tarps, heavy plastic sheeting and duct tape will be valuable in the last hours before a storm hits. While local authorities may make sandbags available to your community, they will be in limited supply or unavailable.</font></p>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4">Get a sump pump or service the one you have.  </font></b></li>
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3">Now that's "sump-thing" to think about! Even if you already have a sump pump, you may as well have your local plumber check it out. A  plumber can clean your sump pit, and remove debris to prolong use of this valuable piece of equipment. A sump pump is among the most important preps you'll have against El Niño. They remove water from basements and crawlspaces and can solve virtually all of your basement flooding and leaking problems. </font></p>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4">Consider a battery backup for your sump pump. </font></b></li>
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3"> To really prepare for El Niño you'll need to overcome potential obstacles. Let's face it: your sump pump is only as good as its source of power. Take charge to ensure you always have a charge and make sure you have a battery backup for your sump pump.</font></p>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4">Inspect your generator or get a generator. </font></b></li>
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3">The time to get a generator is well before the storm. Now's the time to invest in a new generator if the one you own is questionable. Use.Our generator buying guide to get started. Even better than a generator is to get a permanent standby generator to kick in when the power fails.</font></p>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4"> Fix a leaky roof</font></b></li>
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3">John F. Kennedy once said, "The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining." The key to avoiding a leaky roof is routine inspection and repair.</font></p>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4">Clean the gutters regularly</font></b></li>
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3">Clean gutters of debris to ensure no leaves and branches clog the flow of water which will fall. </font></p>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4"> Branch out and check trees in the surrounding property.</font></b></li>
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3">As trees gain water weight they can become a threat to buildings, fences and other property. It's nothing a little tree trimming can't fix, but it's better to consult an arborist than a tree cutter. Trim bushes.</font></p>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4">Maintain the wood trim of your home</font></b></li>
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3"> Repaint exterior trim as cracks in paint may lead to dry rot and something you might not expect - termites!</font></p>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4">Anti-up and get rid of ants and termites!</font></b></li> 
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3">When down comes the rain, the ants will come marching in (along with the termites) unless you take a preemptive strike. Anti-up your pest control! Mix Borax with powdered sugar in places where you suspect ants will enter your home. If you've already found an ant trail, know Windex will kill them and is an effective deterrent for new ants in the army.</font></p>
		</ul>

	<li><font face="century gothic" size="5">Prepare your car for El Niño.</font></li>
		<ul>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4">Keep your gas tank full.  </font></b></li>
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3">Fuel may not be available following a flood as trucks can't get to your area or the destruction is too significant. In theory, preppers never leave their gas tank below the halfway mark.</font></p>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4">Wipe away your wipers.  </font></b></li>
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3">Did you know you can extend the life of your wiper blades by a year by keeping them clean? Wipe the dirt and debris with an alcohol wipe, the kind you might find in your vehicle's first aid kit. Replace wiper blades so you can see where you're going.</font></p>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4">Assault your battery</font></b></li>
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3">Check the car's battery and get rid of it, if its more than three years old . A car battery has a lifetime limited to around about five years.</font></p>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4">Check your tires and rotate them!  </font></b></li>
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3">Keep an eye on treads as they won't be able to displace the water through groves if there isn't much grove left! Keep tires properly inflated so the rubber meets the road properly and you won't hydroplane.</font></p>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4">Turn on your headlights, even during the day. </font></b></li>
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3">In rain having your headlights on during daylight driving will help you two fold: you'll be able to see and you'll be seen!</font></p>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4">Prepare for mud slides </font></b></li>
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3">After drought and wildfire when the rains return aggressively the land can't absorb into the soil. This rain could trigger mud, rocks and debris to come flowing down a hill.</font></p>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4">Caught in a flood while in the car? </font></b></li>
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3">You may feel overly confident in an SUV with four-wheel drive, but know that even two feet of water can sweep your car away into deeper waters quickly. Water pressure on the doors makes it extremely difficult to open the doors for escape.  In any event the door isn't your best exit as opening the door will let in more water, making the car sink faster. Try rolling down the window instead. Power windows will not stop working immediately. Then unbuckle your seat belt. If you act immediately to open the windows, you'll be better able. </font></p> 
		</ul>
	
	<li><font face="century gothic" size="5">Get ready for flash flooding (even on foot).</font></li>
		<p><font face="century gothic" size="3">Heavy and steady rains from El Niño are headed your way in 2016. El Niño is coming with a vengeance and it's important to remember that everyone lives in a flood zone! In addition to preparing your home and car for El Niño, make sure you're ready in case you get caught in flash flooding on foot.</font></p>		
		<ul>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4">Don't go with the flow! </font></b></li>
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3">Never walk through flowing water ~ ever! Even six inches of floodwater can make you lose balance. What's worse, the ground under the water flow may cause you to sink or get stuck.</font></p>
			<li><b><font face="century gothic" size="4">Caught in a flood on foot?</font></b></li>
				<p><font face="century gothic" size="3">You can't fight the current, but you can ride it out the way you'd do if you lost control while river rafting. Point your feet downstream and keep your head up! Now work your way to the flood edge so you can grab hold of a bush or tree to pull yourself up.</font></p>
		</ul>
		
	<li><font face="century gothic" size="5">Prepare your grocery budget!</font></li><br>
		<ul>
			<li><font face="century gothic" size="4"><b>Coffee:</b>Coffee is always a good prep, but now more than ever. As an example, the world's largest producer of Robusta coffee in Vietnam, accoring to U.S. News and World Report.</font></li><br>
			<li><font face="century gothic" size="4"><b>Maple Syrup:</b> Apparently warm winters hurt the tapping season.</font></li><br>
			<li><font face="century gothic" size="4"><b>Palm oil.</b> Palm oil is in all sorts of shelf-stable cookies and sweets. Either curb your sweet tooth, or make your own baked goods.</font></li><br>
			<li><font face="century gothic" size="4"><b>Rice.</b> Rice production is taking a beating in Southeast Asia (Philippines) also according to U.S. News and World Resort.</font></li><br>
			<li><font face="century gothic" size="4"><b>Sugar:</b> Drought prior to El Niño is a cause of rising sugar prices, but it's both cause for high prices. Drought shrivels crops or and the insurgent rains flood them. In Thailand drought shrivels sugar crops, according to Bloomberg.</font></li><br>
			<li><font face="century gothic" size="4"><b>Fish:</b> ocean temperatures are on the rise and this has significant changes on aquatic life and what fisherman can harvest. Wired Magazine summed up in saying El Niño is going to starve a lot of fish.</font></li><br>
